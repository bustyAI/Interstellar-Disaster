# Interstellar Disaster
 
# Project Goal
- For this project passengers have been transported into another dimension, and it is our job to create multiple machine learning models to predict which passengers have been transported.

# Tools Used
- **Python, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Lightgbm, and XgBoost**

# Data Pipeline
- Example pipeline used for Descision Tree Classifier
